  ## Welcome to My Corner of the Internet! 🌐 

  Hi there! My name is Michal Zindulka, and I'm thrilled to have you here. 👋

  I'm a Systems Engineer with over a decade of experience in IT, passionate about exploring the technologies I use and enjoy. Here, I share my thoughts, ideas, and insights about Cloud, DevOps and everything in between.

  ## 🛠 My Journey

  It all started right after high school when I joined the IBM Delivery Center in Brno, Czech Republic, as a 1st-level support technician. Over the years, I climbed the ladder into 2nd-level support and eventually found my passion as a Systems Engineer — a role I truly love.

  My career milestones include:
  - **IBM**: Foundation of my technical journey.
  - **Oriflame Software**: Where my love for Cloud technologies began.
  - **Freelance Projects**: Diverse challenges that kept me sharp and versatile.
  - **Vortex**: Currently serving as a DevOps Engineer at [Vortex](https://vortexcloud.io), embracing innovation every day.

  ## 🔍 What I Do

  I thrive at the intersection of Cloud, DevOps, and automation. My expertise spans across the Big Three cloud providers:
  Azure, AWS, and GCP — and I'm equally with on-premise environments.

  Whether it's managing a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal or leveraging a managed service, I've got it covered.

  ## 🔧 Tools & Practices I Love
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: A cornerstone of my workflow, using tools like Terraform and Ansible.
  - **GitOps Principles**: Enabling seamless, reliable deployments with tools like ArgoCD.
  - **Automation**: From crafting simple scripts to architecting complex CI/CD pipelines — it's what makes my heart race.
